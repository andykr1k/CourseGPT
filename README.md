# CourseGPT - UCR

## UCR Course Repository LLM

The goal of this project is to create an efficient speech-to-text course LLM. With this goal in mind, I will use langchain to help create a vector store with all the necessary data.

## Set Up

### Create Virtual Enviroment and Install Libraries

```shell
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements
```

### Create Enviroment Keys

```shell
touch .env
echo OPEN_AI_KEY='<KEY>' | .env
```

## Utilization

Navigate to main.ipynb and read through the code to understand the flow of the algoritm. 

After doing so, start by running the set up section of the notebook.
